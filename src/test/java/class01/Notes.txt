***********************Review****************************

1. Pom.xml
we put all of our dependencies
<dependencies>


</dependencies>

when we want to load the dependencies as there are red errors
we right-click and reload the maven


2. Annotations:

1. @Test:
        every test case is written is @Test annotation
        whenever we run a class all @Test annotations will be executed
        we can also run them individually

2. @BeforeMethod:
        pre-condition and will execute always before the @Test annotation

3. @AfterMethod:
        post-condition and will execute always after @Test annotation

3. Priority:

    by default: 0 is the highest
    @Test(oriority=1)

    priority flows in this order
    0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-->

4. Enable and disable:

    @Test(enabled=false)
    will mark the test case as disabled and will not be part of the execution

    by default enabled=true;

5. Depends on:
    @Test(dependsonMethod={methodname})
    the test case is dependent on another test case and if the major test case fails it will not execute it

6. Assertions

Hard assertions:

1. Assert.assertEquals(string,string) --->  compares two strings, if they are equal the assertion will pass
   if not equal the assertion will fail.

2. Assert.assertTrue(boolean) ---> will fail if booleab false, will pass if boolean is true.


Note:

if any assertion in case of hard assertions fails, the code doesn't proceed on with execution, it terminates
there and marks the test case as a failed test case.
